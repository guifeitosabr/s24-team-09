# FocusTabs

FocusTabs is a Chrome extension designed to enhance productivity by helping users organize their browsing experience more efficiently. With the ever-growing number of tabs open in our browsers, it's easy to lose track of important information and tasks. FocusTabs aims to solve this problem by allowing users to group tabs based on topics, projects, or any custom category they desire.
