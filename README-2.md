## Chrome Extension Architecture

This project follows the Manifest V3 architecture for Chrome extensions. Key components of the architecture include:

- `manifest.json`: Defines the extension's metadata, permissions, and script configurations
- `background.js`: Runs in the background and handles events and long-running tasks
- `contentScript.js`: Injected into web pages to interact with the DOM and communicate with the background script **(not used here)**
- Popup window: Displays the extension's user interface when the extension icon is clicked

### Manifest V3

This extension is built using the latest version of the Chrome extension manifest (Manifest V3). The `manifest.json` file defines the extension's properties, permissions, and scripts.

Key aspects of the Manifest V3 configuration include:

- `manifest_version`: Set to `3` to use Manifest V3
- `background`: Specifies the background script as a service worker
- `action`: Defines the popup HTML file
- `permissions`: Declares the required permissions for the extension (storage, activeTab, contextMenus)
- `content_scripts`: Specifies the content script to be injected into web pages
